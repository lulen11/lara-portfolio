        Hello! My name&apos;s Lara. I&apos;m a frontend designer. I&apos;ve
        spent the last 10 years working in a special middle-ground between
        design & development. I design user experiences and bring those designs
        to life through frontend code. My specialities lay within UX design and
        frontend development, with lots of experience in web, app & product
        design, as well as start-up consulting. I work remotely, based in
        Melbourne, Australia.
        <span>
          I&apos;m mid-build on this portfolio so I&apos;ve adapted it a little
          to share with you here while I finish it off elsewhere. Please forgive
          the imperfections!

        spend my days collaborating with great teams to design user experiences
