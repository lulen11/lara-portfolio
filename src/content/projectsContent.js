      "At Code Like a Girl, I am the Lead UX Designer & Frontend Developer, contributing across various projects between tech and design. I manage and update the main website, built on Gatsby, adapting new pages as projects arise. I also led the UX/UI design for our Internship Platform, conducting stakeholder interviews, user research with interns and partners, and producing designs that align with user needs. In our School of Code, I wrote and delivered two popular coding courses—Foundations of Web Development and Navigating JavaScript—handling everything from content creation to video editing. In all my work at CLG, I'm working to improve UX for our partners, interns and students and to create supportive, accessible and exciting environments for all people to advance in tech.",

      "In 2021, some fellow creatives and I formed a collective wanting to create digital experiences that put people & planet first. We collaborated to build the new Verve Super website together. My colleague designed the UX/UI while my primary focus was in developing the frontend with one fellow developer. We worked with Wordpress, creating a theme to suit our custom designs. The project was setup with the Twig templating engine, encorporating Tailwind CSS and using Elementor for the client to easily update and add modules as they grew as a company. Below are examples of the UX/UI designs created by my colleague, all of which I developed into lightweight responsive code.",

      "I began freelancing at AIME before being hired into their international team in a frontend development role. For 3 years, we collaborated together to build a mentorship portal for mentors and mentees, the AIME website with an apparel shop, the AIME Blueprint—a design system for consistent styling, and many more mini digital products.  This role had me working with React, Next.js, Gatsby, Tailwind CSS, AWS, Raisely, Shopify and more. I also worked in UX design, managing UX research and maintaining our design system. My work involved managing timezone and remote collaboration across Europe, America and Australia—adapting to diverse project needs, and maintaining consistent UX and visual styles across products. My experience at AIME taught me to coordinate effectively and confidently in a large-scale, fast-paced, globally distributed team. I'm proud of the work we did together and the positive impact it had on the AIME community. We successfully built, launched, and maintained these products for a diverse group of users and stakeholders. Although they're no longer live due to changes within the company, here are some stills showcasing our work, along with a selection of public codebases below.",

My role in this project was focused on designing wireframes and then collaborating closely with <a href='https://dribbble.com/secruza' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> my friend and talented UI designer, Seb</a> to turn from UX to UI. We worked closely with the client, incorporating feedback to refine the product iteratively in Figma. This role involved balancing early-stage design with actionable insights, allowing the product to evolve in line with stakeholder feedback. It emphasised adaptability and the ability to translate abstract ideas into structured designs. Although the product is not live, here are some mockups showcasing the work we designed together.",
